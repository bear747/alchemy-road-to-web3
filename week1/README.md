Goals: Mint an NFT

Notes:

OpenSea Account (Testnet): https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/bear747

Contract Address: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xa44d227d1bc52b41eaa09d0829660021823dac76

AFAIK I've followed all the tutorial steps correctly. I'm able to mint the NFT but the png image isn't appearing on Opensea.

When uploading the metadata.json file to filebase, make sure to use the upload tool rather than just dragging and dropping, because that seems to do something funny to the json files.

To run the safemint function, it's ipfs://YOUR_IMAGE_CID

Not sure why my attempts to make an NFT with bear747 failed?!
